           Dholavira (Gujarati: ધોળાવીરા) is an archaeological site at Khadirbet in Bhachau Taluka of Kutch District, in the state of Gujarat in western India, which has taken its name from a modern-day village 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) south of it. This village is 165 km (103 mi) from Radhanpur. Also known locally as Kotada timba, the site contains ruins of a city of the ancient Indus Valley civilization. Earthquakes have repeatedly affected Dholavira, including a particularly severe one around 2600 BCE.

                Location
            </h3>
                Dholavira's location is on the Tropic of Cancer. It is one of the five largest Harappan sites and the most prominent of archaeological sites in India belonging to the Indus Valley Civilization. It is located on Khadir Bet island in the Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary in the Great Rann of Kutch. The 47 ha (120 acres) quadrangular city lay between two seasonal streams, the Mansar in the north and Manhar in the south. The site was thought to be occupied from c.2650 BCE, declining slowly after about 2100 BCE, and to have been briefly abandoned then reoccupied until c.1450 BCE; however, recent research suggests the beginning of occupation around 3500 BCE (pre-Harappan) and continuity until around 1800 BCE (early part of Late Harappan period).

                Discovery
            </h3>
            The site was initially discovered by a resident of Dholavira village, Shambhudan Gadhvi, in early 1960s, who made efforts to bring government attention to the location.The site was "officially" discovered in 1967-68 by J. P. Joshi, of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and is the fifth largest of eight major Harappan sites. It has been under excavation since 1990 by the ASI, which opined that "Dholavira has indeed added new dimensions to personality of Indus Valley Civilisation."<br>The other major Harappan sites discovered so far are Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Ganeriwala, Rakhigarhi, Kalibangan, Rupnagar and Lothal.<br>It was named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name Dholavira: a Harappan City on 27 July 2021.

                Timeline
            </h4>    
               Ravindra Singh Bisht, the director of the Dholavira excavations, has defined the following seven stages of occupation at the site:
                Stages	Time	Events
                Stage I	    2650–2550 BCE	Early Harappan – Mature Harappan Transition A
                Stage II	2550–2500 BCE	Early Harappan – Mature Harappan Transition B
                Stage III	2500–2200 BCE	Mature Harappan A
                Stage IV	2200–2000 BCE	Mature Harappan B
                Stage V	    2000–1900 BCE	Mature Harappan C
                            1900–1850 BCE	Period of desertion
                Stage VI	1850–1750 BCE	Posturban Harappan A
                            1750–1650 BCE	Period of desertion
                Stage VII	1650–1450 BCE	Posturban Harappan B<br>Recent C14 datings and stylistic comparisons with Amri II-B period pottery show the first two phases should be termed Pre-Harappan Dholaviran Culture and re-dated as follows: Stage I (c. 3500-3200 BCE), and Stage II (c. 3200-2600 BCE).
